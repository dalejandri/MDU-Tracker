## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Files won't upload to GitHub"
→ Make sure you're uploading HTML, not ZIP
→ Files should be under 100MB (index.html is ~2MB, OK)
→ Try uploading one at a time

### "GitHub Pages URL shows 404"
→ Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
→ Check Settings → Pages shows green checkmark

### "Tracker loads but SharePoint doesn't show it"
→ Use iframe/embed method, not direct upload
→ SharePoint blocks uploaded HTML from executing
→ MUST use GitHub Pages URL, not uploaded file

### "Changes aren't appearing"
→ Clear browser cache
→ Wait 1-2 minutes after GitHub update
→ Try incognito window

### "Team can't see my updates"
→ Did you upload to GitHub?
→ Are they using GitHub Pages URL?
→ Try CSV method instead
